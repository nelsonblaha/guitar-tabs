Broadripple Is Burning by Margot and the Nuclear So and So's

Tabbed by Sean Fisk

This is a tab of the demo version, which, in my opinion, is much better than the album version(s).

Use your pinky to mute the top string if strumming. If finger-picking, just don't play it.

Capo 4 for original. I play capo 3.


Verse 1:

       Em             Cmaj7
Honey, Broadripple is burning
        G6
and the girls are getting sick
             Em             Cmaj7
Off snorting coke up in the bathroom
            G6
while their boyfriends pick up chicks
                 Em
And darling, I'm lost
            Cmaj7            G6
I heard you whisperin' that night in Fountain Square
                 Em              Cmaj7               G6
The trash-filled streets made me wish we were headed home


Verse 2:

              Em              Cmaj7
And there was love inside the basement
           G6
where that woman used to lie
     Em              Cmaj7
In a sleeping bag we shared upon
    G6
the floor most every night
                 Em
And darling, I'm drunk
         Cmaj7               G6
and everything I that I have loved has turned to stone
             Em
So pack your bags
    Cmaj7     G6
and come back home


Chorus:

        Em
And I'm wasted
        Cmaj7
You can taste it
      G6      G/F#    Em
Don't look at me that way
               Cmaj7          Em
'Cause I'll be hanging from a rope
        Cmja7          Em
I'll be hanging from a rope


Verse 3:

And if my woman was a fire
She'd burn out before I wake
And be replaced by pints of whiskey
Cigarettes and outer space
Then somebody moves
And everything you thought you had has gone to shit
We've got a lot
Don't ever forget that


Verse 4:

And I wrote this on an airplane
where the people looked like ants
And when a woman that you loved is gone
she's bombing east Japan
And don't fucking move
'cause everything you think you have will go to shit
We've got a lot
Don't you dare forget that


Chorus:

And I'm wasted
You can taste it
Don't look at me that way
'Cause I'll be hanging from a rope
I'll be hanging from a rope

And I'm wasted
You can taste it
Don't look at me that way
'Cause I'll be hanging from a rope
I'll be hanging from a rope
