Verse 1:

C
  Dyed in the wool, you been
Am
   cornered by a
 Em
natural desire, you wanna
F
hop along, with the giddy throng, through life.
C
  But how will you learn
Em                 F                 G
steer, when you're grinding all your gears?

Verse 2:

C
You've been talkin' for
Am
hours, you say,
Em
"Time will wash every
 F
tower to the sea."
    C
But now you've got this,
Em      F       G
worry in your heart.

Pre-chorus:

Well I guess it's
F
only life, it's only natural
G
              we all spend a
F
little while goin' down the rabbit
  G
hole, the things they
Am
taught ya, they're lining up to
  C
haunt ya, they've got your back against the
G           F        Em
wall.

F
Called you on the telephone
(F)                     G--G (two strums)
Won't you pick up the receiver

Chorus:

C
  I've been down the very
G              F
road you're wal-kin' now.
C
  It doesn't have to be so
Em           F
dark and lone-some
C
  Takes a while but we can
G          F
figure this thing out
Em
    and turn it back
  G
around

Interlude:



Verse 3:

    C
You used to be such a
 Am
lion
  Em
before you got into all this
  F
cryin' on my lap
C
Back when you thought I'd
Em       F      G
Never get this far

Pre-chorus:

But did you
F
really think I'd shut an open door?
G
                the future's
 F
callin', and I'mma answer-er
G
 -er-er, the wheels in
 Am
motion, I never drank your
 C
potion, and I know it breaks your
G           F        Em
heart.

F
Open up your parachute
(F)                       G----G (two strums)
Somethin's gotta stop the free-fall

Chorus:

C
  I've been down the very
G              F
road you're wal-kin' now.
C
  It doesn't have to be so
Em           F
dark and lone-some
C
  Takes a while but we can
G          F
figure this thing out
Em
    and turn it back
  G
around
