Verse 1:

A                          D
  Laura and Tommy were lovers
NC                    D
He wanted to give her everything
C#m      Bm        E7
Flowers, presents, but most of all, a wedding ring

A                     D
  He saw a sign for a stock car race
A                   D
  A thousand dollar prize it read
   C#m                Bm
He couldn't get Laura on the phone
   E7
So to her mother, Tommy said


Chorus:

A
  Tell Laura I love her
             Bm
Tell Laura I need her
             A
Tell Laura I may be late
     Bm                           A
I've something to do, that cannot wait


Verse 2:

A                         D
  He drove his car to the racing grounds
A                     D
  He was the youngest driver there
        C#m                  Bm
And the crowd roared as they started the race
           E7
'Round the track they drove at a deadly pace

A                   D
  No one knows what happened that day
A                 D
  How his car overturned in flames
    C#m                          Bm
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
         E7
With his dying breath, they heard him say


Chorus:

A
  Tell Laura I love her
             Bm
Tell Laura I need her
           A
Tell Laura not to cry
   Bm                      A
My love for her will never die


Verse 3:

A                   D
  And in the chapel   where Laura prayed
A                    D
  For her Tommy, who passed away
       C#                Bm
It was just for Laura he lived and died
  E7
Alone in the chapel she can hear him cry


Chorus:

A
  Tell Laura I love her
             Bm
Tell Laura I need her
           A
Tell Laura not to cry
   Bm                      A
My love for her will never die
