INTRO:
Am Em F C (x2)        *single strums

Am                       Em   F   C
Bury all your secrets in my skin
Am                       Em  F                       C
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
    Am                          Em   F      C
The air around me still feels like a cage
    Am                       Em   F
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

Am Em F C | Am Em F   *strummed

               C          G
So if you love me, let me go
                      Am
And run away before I know
                        G
My heart is just too dark to care
                          Am
I can't destroy what isn't there

                   G
Deliver me into my fate
                    Am
If I'm alone I cannot hate
                        G
I don't deserve to have you

         F
Oooh, my smile was taken long ago
                               Am
If I can change I hope I never know

(Am) Em F C | Am Em F C

Am                            Em F     C
I still press your letters to my lips
Am                          Em  F                C
Cherish them in parts of me and savor every kiss
Am                             Em   F      C
I couldn't face a life without your light
Am                             Em F
But all of that was ripped apart   when you refused to fight

                      C        G
So save your breath I will not care
                          Am
I think I've made it very clear
                        G
You couldn't hate enough to love
                     Am
Is that supposed to be enough?

                          G
I only wish you weren't my friend
                         Am
Then I could hurt you in the end
                      G
I never claimed to be a saint

         F
Oooh, my home was banished long ago
                                     Am
It took the death of Hope to let you go

(Am) Em F C | Am Em F

                  C          G
So break yourself against my stones
                        Am
And spit your pity in my soul 
                     G
You never needed any help
                        Am
You sold me out to save yourself

                      Am
And I won't listen to your shame
                         G
You ran away, you're all the same
              Am
Angels lie to keep control

         F
Oooh, my love was punished long ago
                                   Am
If you still care don't ever let me know

(Am) Em F

                             C      Am
If you still care don't ever let me know
