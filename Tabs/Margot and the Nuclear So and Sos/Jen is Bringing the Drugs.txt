Use your pinky to mute the top string if strumming. If finger-picking, just don't play it.


Verse 1:

G      Cmaj7          Em
Jen is bringin' the drugs
                     Cmaj7      D/F#  Em
She wants to get real     fucked    up
             Cmaj7      D/F#
She used to laugh and smile
        Em
But the years of denial
     Cmaj7                    D7
Have taken their toll on her dial


Verse 2:
    G    Cmaj7      Em
But me I do as I please
                      Cmaj7   D/F#    Em
I caught you and I set     you    free
                    Cmaj7  D/F#
'Cause I have been left   alone
       Em
By the people I've known
       Cmaj7                         D7
And I don't know when they're comin' home


Verse 3:
    G         Cmaj7     Em
And Jen don't wanna be seen
                        Cmaj7  D/F#     Em
But I saw her in a swank     ma - ga - zine
            Cmaj7      D/F#
She had an airbrushed face
          Em
But the lines of distaste
     Cmaj7                        D7
Were crossed without crossin' of legs


Verse 4:
    G       Cmaj7     Em
And I don't wanna be found
                 Cmaj7     D/F#   Em
So when you get home I'm skippin' town
                Cmaj7    D/F#
I'm leavin' to go some - place
      Em
Where nobody will
Cmaj7                  D7
Have any clue where I am


Verse 5:
    G      Cmaj7          Em
And Jen is bringin' the drugs
                  Cmaj7      D/F#  Em
She's gonna get me     fucked    up
                    Cmaj7   D/F#
'Cause love is an inkless pen
        Em
It's a tavern, it's sin
        Cmaj7          D7
It's a horrible way to begin
