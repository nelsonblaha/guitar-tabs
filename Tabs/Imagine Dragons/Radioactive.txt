Radioactive (London Sessions version)
by Imagine Dragons

Tuned half-step down

Am         C             G 
I'm waking up to ash and dust
       D                   Am
I wipe brow but I sweat my rust
          C            G  
Breathing in the chemicals
Am       C           G            D                    Am
Breaking in, shaping up, checking out on the prison bus
        C            G
This is it, the apocalypse
D
Woah                                                      Am  C  G  D
                                                        --0---0--3--2--
           Am            C                              --1---1--0--3--
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones                    --2---0--0--2--
 G                D                                     --2---2--0--0--
Enough to make my system blow                           --0---3--2--0--
Am                     C                                --0---0--3--0--
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
G                      D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Am    C       G            D
Woah, woah I'm radioactive, radioactive
Am    C       G            D
Woah, woah I'm radioactive, radioactive

Am            C         G
I raise my flag, don my clothes
           D            Am
It's a revolution, I suppose
        C                     G        D
Painted red just to fit right in, woah
Am       C           G            D                    Am
Breaking in, shaping up, checking out on the prison bus
        C            G
This is it, the apocalypse
D
Woah

           Am            C
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
 G                D
Enough to make my system blow
Am                     C
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
G                      D
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Am    C       G            D

Am          C   G          D
All systems go, sun hasn't died
Am         C      G             D
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

           Am            C
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
 G                D

Woah, woah I'm radioactive, radioactive
