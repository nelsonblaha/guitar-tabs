Intro: C C/G6 Am Am7 Fmaj G C*

     C      C/G6       Am        Am7     
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
Fmaj                       G
The regular crowd shuffles in                                     C C/G6 Am Am7 Fmaj G
           C    C/G6       Am          Am7                      --0---0--0---0---1---3
There's an old man sitting next to me                           --1---1--1---1---1---0
       Fmaj        G         C                                  --0---0--2---2---2---0
Making love to his tonic and gin                                --2---0--2---2---3---0
                                                                --3---2--0---0---3---2
          C            C/G6      Am      Am7                    --0---3--0---3---1---3
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory
    Fmaj                   G                                    * indicates to embellish chord
I'm not really sure how it goes
         C            C/G6        Am         Am7
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
     Fmaj     G             C        
When I wore a younger man's clothes."

Am              C*
La la la, di da da
Am           C          G
La la, di di da da dum

C         C/G6             Am         Am7
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F               G
Sing us a song tonight
            C          C/G6       Am      Am7
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
    F             G         C*     
And you've got us feeling alright

    C           C/G6     Am              Am7
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
   F                     G
He gets me my drinks for free
         C            C/G6           Am            Am7
And he's quick with a joke and he'll light up your smoke
            F              G           C*
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

          C         C/G6          Am            Am7
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
       F                       G
As the smile ran away from his face
          C           C/G6       Am           Am7
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
   F           G           C
If I could get out of this place."

Am              C*
La la la, di da da
Am           C          G
La la, di di da da dum

    C         C/G6        Am        Am7
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
    F                    G
Who never had time for a wife
         C            C/G6        Am           Am7
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
    F        G           C    
And probably will be for life

        C           C/G6       Am        Am7
And the waitress is practicing politics
       F                       G
As the businessman slowly gets stoned
             C         C/G6            Am          Am7
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
         F           G         C   
But it's better than drinking alone

SOLO

C         C/G6             Am         Am7
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F               G

            C          C/G6       Am      Am7
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

And you've got us feeling alright

       C           C/G6        Am        Am7
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
        F                  G
And the manager gives me a smile
          C               C/G6            Am          Am7
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
   F            G          C    
To forget about life for a while

        C         C/G6          Am        Am7
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
        F                        G
And the microphone smells like a beer
         C          C/G6        Am          Am7
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
          F             G         C   
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"

Am              C*
La la la, di da da
Am           C          G
La la, di di da da dum

Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
    F             G         C     
And you've got us feeling alright
