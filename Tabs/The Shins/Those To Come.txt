Verse 1:

D                      D
Eyeless in the mornin' sun you were
D                D
Pale and mild, a modern girl
D                          D
Taken with thoughts, still prone to care
 D                 D
Makin' tea in your underwear, you went
A                       A
out in the yard to find
A                       A
(no lyrics)
A                     A
Somethin' to eat, and clear your mind
Asus2                Asus2
Somethin' bad inside       me went away

D x 4

Verse 2:

D                  D
Quakin' leaves and broken light
D                  D
Shiftin' skin, the coming night
    D                   D
The bearers of all good things arise
D                D
Climb inside us, twist and cry
  A                         A
A kiss on your molten eyes
A                        A
(no lyrics)
A                 A
Myriad lies, like blades of grass
Asus2               Asus2
Yet to be realized,       bow as they pass

D x 4

Interlude:

They are
D     D
Cold, still
D              D
Waiting in the ether to
Em    Em
Form, feel
Em    Em         Em
Kill, propagate, only to
D        D
die
D        D

Instrumental:

D x 8
A x 6
Asus2 x 2
D x 4

Interlude:

They are
D     D
Cold, still
D              D
Waiting in the ether to
Em    Em
Form, feel
Em    Em         Em
Kill, propagate, only to
D       D
die, dissolve
D          D
Magically, absurdly they'll
Em   Em
End, leave
Em         Em        Em
Dissapate, coldy and strangely
  D            D
Return
D              D

Outro:

D until end
