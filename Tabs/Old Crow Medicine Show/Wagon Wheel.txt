I made it down the coast in seventeen hours

Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
          G
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh

G                     D
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
      Em                    C
I was born to fiddler in an old time string band
   G
My baby plays a guitar
D              C
I pick a banjo now

        G                            D
Oh, the north-country winters keep a gettin' me down
        Em                       C
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
      G
But I ain't a turnin' back

G                    D
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
           Em
I caught a trucker outta Philly
      C
Had a nice long toke
    G                           D
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
   C
To Johnson City, Tennessee

      G                   D
And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun
          Em
I hear my baby callin' my name
      C
And I know that she's the only one
    G  
And if I die in Raleigh
   D                C
At least I will die free

   G                   D
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Em               C
