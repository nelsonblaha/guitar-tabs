Verse 1:

     C      C/B       Am        Am7
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

F                       G
The regular crowd shuffles in 

           C    C/B       Am          Am7
There's an old man sitting next to me

       F        G         C
Making love to his tonic and gin
                                  

C C/B Am Am7 F G C

          C            C/B      Am      Am7
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory

    F                   G
I'm not really sure how it goes

         C            C/B        Am         Am7
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete

     F        G             C
When I wore a younger man's clothes."


Chorus:

Am              C
La la la, di da da

Am           C          G
La la, di di da da dum


C         C/B             Am         Am7
Sing us a song, you're the piano man

F               G
Sing us a song tonight

            C          C/B       Am      Am7
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

    F             G         C     
And you've got us feeling alright


Verse 2:

    C           C/B      Am              Am7
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine

   F                     G
He gets me my drinks for free

         C            C/B            Am            Am7
And he's quick with a joke and he'll light up your smoke
 
           F               G           C
But there's someplace that he'd rather be


          C         C/B          Am            Am7
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."

       F                       G
As the smile ran away from his face

          C           C/B       Am           Am7
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star

   F           G           C
If I could get out of this place."


Am              C
La la la, di da da

Am           C          G
La la, di di da da dum


Verse 3:

    C         C/B        Am        Am7
Now Paul is a real estate novelist

    F                    G
Who never had time for a wife

         C            C/B        Am           Am7
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy

    F        G           C    
And probably will be for life


        C           C/B       Am        Am7
And the waitress is practicing politics

       F                       G
As the businessman slowly gets stoned

             C         C/B            Am          Am7
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness

         F           G         C   
But it's better than drinking alone


Chorus:

C         C/B             Am         Am7
Sing us a song, you're the piano man

F               G
Sing us a song tonight

            C          C/B       Am      Am7
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

    F             G         C     
And you've got us feeling alright


Verse 4:

       C           C/B        Am        Am7
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday

        F                  G
And the manager gives me a smile

          C               C/B            Am          Am7
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see

   F            G          C    
To forget about life for a while


        C         C/B          Am        Am7
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival

        F                        G
And the microphone smells like a beer

         C          C/B        Am          Am7
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar

          F             G         C   
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"


Am              C
La la la, di da da

Am           C          G
La la, di di da da dum


Chorus:

C         C/B             Am         Am7
Sing us a song, you're the piano man

F               G
Sing us a song tonight

            C          C/B       Am      Am7
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody

    F             G         C     
And you've got us feeling alright
